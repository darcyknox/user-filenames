COSC326 Etude 10 - User Filenames

EXPLANATION:

UserFilenames.java is a program that accepts a directory name as a command line argument. Within that local folder should be a series of plaintext files, and potentially other subdirectories which themselves may contain files and subdirectories. This program walks this directory structure, assembles a list of files to be read in sequential order, reads the contents of those files, and saves the concatenated output to a single file.

HOW TO RUN:

To compile, use the command:
javac UserFilenames.java

Next, run the program with the command:
java UserFilenames directory-name
