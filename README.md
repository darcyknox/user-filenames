# user-filenames
COSC326 Etude 10

EXPLANATION:

UserFilenames.java is a program that accepts a directory name as a command line argument. Within
that local folder should be a series of plaintext files, and potentially other subdirectories
which themselves may contain files and subdirectories. This program walks this
directory structure, assembles a list of files to be read in sequential order, reads the contents of those files, and saves the concatenated output to a single file.

HOW TO RUN:

To run the program, first compile the program with the command "javac UserFilenames.java" without quotation marks.
Next, run the program with the command "java UserFilenames <directory name>" without quotation marks or pointy brackets, and where the text inside the ponty rackets are replaced with a directory name.
